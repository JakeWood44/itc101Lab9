            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>I've always loved music, even as a little kid. I especially loved a certain genre that I never really knew the name for, but when I heard it I knew it. I went on to find out this genre was dubstep and other heavy EDM genres, and they hold a special place in my heart to this day. In my pursuit of these genres, I happened to learn how to produce music as well, and I've gotten pretty good at it in the last 7 years. I've released one 10-track album and 3 singles, with more on the way. While I'm not banking on my music career taking off and supporting my family, I keep making it because it helps me process my emotions in ways that other things can't.</p>
            
            <h3>Flipping/Tricking</h3>
            <p>I also have an obsession with basically "doing cool things", but this one emerged more recently. I think I realized it was more of a possibility when I learned to do a backflip on grass (in my backyard, alone, with no mats, by the way). I realized that the things they do in movies, while not always practical, are achievable with enough effort. I don't put as much practice into this as I want to, mostly because I look like an idiot doing it in public, but I've been slowly getting better. Right now I'm working on a flash gainer out of a Gumbi (like a weird version of a round off backflip) on grass, and Sukahara (front flip 180 then backflip in the same jump) on tramp.</p>


            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>My third love is coding, logic and efficiency. In my early years, this took the form of a love for math, where every question had a single correct answer, with no room for deviation from the truth. I really appreciated the order of the subject, compared to the chaotic millions of possible answers for English essays or even Science questions. And while I do still love math, what I have found I truly enjoy is coding and efficiency. Logic that works perfectly. There is something so satisfying about it to me, using comptuers in exactly the most efficient way with no overhead. My current projects include 4 games and half of a game engine, but I'm only really working on two of them: BulletLife and Jello Fight.</p>
